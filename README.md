# Serve AI Models on Any Linux Machine

_Red Hat AI Inference in a single container. Open-weight models at zero cost per token._

> This quickstart is the companion to [From Zero to Benchmark: Deploying LLM Inference on CPU with RHAII 3.5](URL).

## Overview

Red Hat AI Inference (RHAII) is a production-grade model serving engine — the same vLLM-based runtime that powers Red Hat AI on OpenShift. It also runs standalone on any Linux machine as a single container.

This quickstart walks you through it:

1. Pick a model (Granite 2B or Qwen 7B)
2. Pull the container image
3. Serve the model
4. Call it with the OpenAI-compatible API

The models are open-weight. The runtime is enterprise-supported. Everything runs on your CPU.

## What the result looks like

By the end, you'll have a model running locally that responds like this:

> **You ask:** "What are the advantages of running AI models on-premises?"
>
> **The model responds:** "1. Cost control — no per-token API fees. 2. Data sovereignty — sensitive data never leaves your network. 3. Customization — run any open-weight model, fine-tune for your domain."

The API is identical to OpenAI's — any application or framework that works with OpenAI works with this.

## One-click start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkershawrh/rhaiis-cpu-quickstart.git
cd rhaiis-cpu-quickstart
./start.sh
```

The script checks your system, asks which model to serve, handles credentials, pulls the server, loads the model, and runs your first inference call — including a classification demo.

To match the blog's exact configuration:

```bash
MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct ./start.sh
```

## What you need

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| x86_64 Linux | RHEL 9/10, Fedora, Ubuntu 22.04+ (bare metal or VM — not Mac podman) |
| RAM | 16 GB minimum (Granite 2B) / 32 GB (Qwen 7B) |
| CPU cores | 4+ minimum, 16+ recommended |
| Podman or Docker | Any container runtime |
| Red Hat registry access | Free account at [access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com) for the container image |
| Hugging Face token | Free account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) to download model weights |
| Internet access | To pull the container image and model |

> **Why 16–32 GB?** The inference server loads the full model into memory and allocates a KV cache for processing requests. A 2B parameter model in bfloat16 needs ~4 GB for weights plus several GB for the cache. A 7B model needs ~14 GB for weights plus a 10 GB cache. This is the same architecture that serves models in production — it trades memory for speed and reliability.
>
> **Don't have 16 GB or Linux?** This quickstart is for the production runtime. If you want to experiment on a laptop first, [Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs the same Granite models with lower memory requirements on any OS.

---

## Pick your hardware

Not every model runs on every server. Here's what works where:

| Model Size | Minimum RAM | Intel Xeon Generation | Example Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤1B (tiny) | 8 GB | 4th Gen+ (Sapphire Rapids) | granite-4.0-tiny, TinyLlama-1.1B |
| 2-3B (small) | 16 GB | 4th Gen+ (Sapphire Rapids) | granite-3.3-2b, qwen2.5-3b, phi-3-mini |
| 7-8B (medium) | 32 GB | 5th Gen+ (Emerald Rapids) | granite-3.3-8b, llama-3.1-8b, mistral-7b |
| 14B+ (large) | 64 GB+ | 6th Gen (Granite Rapids) recommended | qwen3-14b, deepseek-r1-14b |

> **Validated reference:** The blog post validated this quickstart on an AWS c8i.12xlarge (48 vCPUs, 96 GB RAM, Intel Xeon 6 / Granite Rapids).

**What matters most:**
- **RAM** is the hard constraint — the model must fit in memory plus KV cache overhead
- **Cores** affect throughput — more cores = more concurrent requests. At 8 cores, expect ~9 tok/s; at 16 cores, ~15 tok/s; at 32 cores, ~283 tok/s at concurrency=32
- **AMX** (available on 4th Gen+) accelerates bfloat16 inference ~2-3x over older AVX-512

---

## Before you start

Here's what the pieces are and how they fit together:

**Red Hat AI Inference (RHAII)** is the production model serving engine built on vLLM. It's the same runtime that Red Hat AI deploys on OpenShift — but it also runs standalone as a container on any Linux machine. Enterprise-supported, optimized for Intel and AMD CPUs, with automatic hardware acceleration detection. RHAII 3.5 automatically handles OpenMP thread optimization — no manual `LD_PRELOAD` configuration needed.

**The models** are open-weight — you can download, run, and modify them without paying per token. This quickstart offers two choices:
- **IBM Granite 2B** — lightweight, Apache 2.0 licensed, good for classification, extraction, and summarization
- **Qwen 2.5 7B** — higher quality reasoning, matches the RHAII 3.5 blog configuration

**The container image** (`registry.redhat.io/rhaii/vllm-cpu-rhel9`) bundles the inference server with all dependencies. Model weights are cached on your host so subsequent starts skip the download.

## Step 1: Log in to the registries

The container image comes from the Red Hat registry. The model weights come from Hugging Face. Log in to both:

```bash
podman login registry.redhat.io
```

Enter your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials (free account at [access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com)).

Set your Hugging Face token as an environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token_here
```

You can create a free token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

Create a persistent cache directory for model weights:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/rhaii-cache
```

## Step 2: Start the inference server

**Granite 2B** (16 GB RAM):

```bash
podman run -d --name inference-server \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --shm-size=4g \
  --security-opt=label=disable \
  --userns=keep-id:uid=1001 \
  -v ~/rhaii-cache:/opt/app-root/src/.cache:Z \
  -e "HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN" \
  -e "VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=4" \
  registry.redhat.io/rhaii/vllm-cpu-rhel9:3.5.0-1786546771 \
  --model ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --max-model-len 2048
```

**Qwen 7B** (32 GB RAM, matches the blog):

```bash
podman run -d --name inference-server \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --shm-size=8g \
  --security-opt=label=disable \
  --userns=keep-id:uid=1001 \
  -v ~/rhaii-cache:/opt/app-root/src/.cache:Z \
  -e "HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN" \
  -e "VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=10" \
  registry.redhat.io/rhaii/vllm-cpu-rhel9:3.5.0-1786546771 \
  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --max-model-len 4096
```

**What the flags do:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-p 8000:8000` | Map port 8000 for the API |
| `--shm-size=4g/8g` | Shared memory for the inference engine (scale with model size) |
| `--security-opt=label=disable` | Bypass SELinux labeling for bind-mounted volumes (RHEL) |
| `--userns=keep-id:uid=1001` | Map host user to the container's application user |
| `-v ~/rhaii-cache:...:Z` | Persistent model cache — weights survive container restarts |
| `HF_TOKEN` | Authenticates with Hugging Face to download model weights |
| `VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE` | KV cache size in GB (4 for 2B models, 10 for 7B) |
| `--host 0.0.0.0` | Listen on all interfaces |
| `--dtype bfloat16` | Use bfloat16 precision for CPU inference |
| `--max-model-len` | Limit context length to manage memory |

> **Using Docker?** Omit `--security-opt=label=disable` and `--userns=keep-id:uid=1001` — these are podman-specific flags for SELinux and user namespace mapping.

The first run downloads the model weights (~4 GB for Granite 2B, ~14 GB for Qwen 7B). Subsequent starts use the cached weights in `~/rhaii-cache`.

## Step 3: Wait for the model to load

Watch the logs:

```bash
podman logs -f inference-server
```

When you see this line, the server is ready:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching. The server keeps running in the background.

> **How long does this take?** First run: 3-10 minutes (model download + loading). After that: 1-2 minutes (loading from cache). On newer CPUs with more cores, loading is faster.

## Step 4: Verify the server

Check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health && echo " healthy"
```

Confirm the model is loaded:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/models | jq .
```

You should see your model ID in the response.

## Step 5: Ask a question

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the advantages of running AI on-premises? Answer in 3 bullet points."}],
    "max_tokens": 150
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.content'
```

> **Using Qwen 7B?** Replace the model value with `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` in the curl commands below.

You should get a coherent answer. This came from Red Hat AI Inference running on your CPU — the same engine that powers production deployments on OpenShift.

## Step 6: Classify text

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Classify this text as positive, negative, or neutral. Respond with one word only.\n\nText: The new processor delivers exceptional performance at lower power consumption."}],
    "max_tokens": 5
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.content'
```

Try a negative example:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Classify this text as positive, negative, or neutral. Respond with one word only.\n\nText: The deployment failed repeatedly and the documentation was outdated."}],
    "max_tokens": 5
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.content'
```

One model, different prompts, different tasks — no retraining needed.

## Step 7: Extract structured data

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract all product names and companies from this text as a JSON array.\n\nText: Red Hat OpenShift serves IBM Granite models for production AI workloads."}],
    "max_tokens": 150
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.content'
```

The same model handled question answering, classification, and data extraction.

## Clean up

```bash
podman stop inference-server && podman rm inference-server
```

The model weights in `~/rhaii-cache` are preserved for faster restarts. To remove them:

```bash
rm -rf ~/rhaii-cache
```

## What you just did

This quickstart is the "Hello World" of self-hosted AI — a quick validation that you have the inference server running, the model is serving, and the performance is roughly what you'd expect. You proved:

- Red Hat AI Inference (RHAII 3.5) runs on your hardware
- Open-weight models handle real tasks (classification, extraction, Q&A)
- The API is OpenAI-compatible — anything you build here works everywhere
- Model weights are cached locally for fast restarts
- The cost per token is zero

The next question is: what do you build with it?

---

## Benchmark your hardware

Measure throughput and latency with the same toolchain used in the blog post:

```bash
./benchmark.sh
```

The script installs [cpueval](https://github.com/redhat-et/vllm-cpu-perf-eval), runs a chat-smoke test suite against your running server, and reports:

- **TTFT** — Time to First Token (prompt evaluation delay)
- **TPOT** — Time per Output Token (generation speed)
- **Tok/s** — Aggregate throughput across parallel streams

For detailed interpretation and advanced benchmarking (NUMA pinning, multi-node setups, interactive dashboards), see the [blog post](URL).

## Add a chat UI

[Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) provides a browser-based chat interface for your running server:

```bash
podman run -d --name open-webui \
  -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=http://host.containers.internal:8000/v1 \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Create an admin account and start chatting.

> **Note:** `host.containers.internal` lets the Open WebUI container reach the inference server running in its own container. On Docker, use `host.docker.internal` instead.

## What makes this different from other runtimes

| | Red Hat AI Inference (RHAII) | Other runtimes (Ollama, llama.cpp) |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | vLLM — production throughput, continuous batching | llama.cpp — lightweight, single-user |
| **Support** | Enterprise-supported by Red Hat | Community-supported |
| **Path to production** | Same container deploys on OpenShift with scaling, monitoring, model management | Manual deployment |
| **Threading** | Automatic OpenMP optimization in 3.5 (no manual LD_PRELOAD) | Manual tuning |
| **Minimum RAM** | 16 GB (production architecture) | 4-8 GB |
| **Best for** | Teams evaluating production AI infrastructure | Individual experimentation |

> **Starting smaller?** [Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs the same IBM Granite models with lower memory on Mac, Linux, or Windows. Great for experimentation. When you're ready for production, Red Hat AI Inference is the path forward.

## Try other models

The inference server runs any Hugging Face model. Swap the `--model` flag (or set `MODEL=` before running `start.sh`) to try these:

| Model | Params | License | Good for | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` | 7B | Apache 2.0 | Multilingual reasoning | **Matches the RHAII 3.5 blog post**. Needs 32 GB RAM |
| `ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct` | 2B | Apache 2.0 | Classification, extraction, Q&A | **Default in this quickstart**. Runs on 16 GB |
| `ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct` | 8B | Apache 2.0 | Better reasoning, longer outputs | Needs ~32 GB RAM |
| `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` | 3B | Apache 2.0 | Multilingual, strong on benchmarks | Origin: CN — check your org's policy |
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B` | 7B | MIT | Reasoning, chain-of-thought | Origin: CN |
| `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` | 3.8B | MIT | Compact, strong reasoning | |
| `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0` | 1.1B | Apache 2.0 | Ultra-lightweight, 8 GB RAM | Good for testing on lower-spec machines |

> **Regional note:** Some organizations restrict the use of models originating from specific countries. IBM Granite is a safe default for all geos.
